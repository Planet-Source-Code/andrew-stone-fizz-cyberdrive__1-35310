### Description

This GUI Interface will create Virtual Drives on your system. Say you have C:\ as a harddrive and D:\ as a CDROM. You can instantly make W:\ point right to C:\GAMES. Or make Q:\ point to your CDROM drive. Or R:\ become C:\windows! Use any letter. Shows up in explorer and dos mode.
 
### More Info
 
**NOTE: Some users experience a "file not found" error when first starting.. this is normal, and will only happen once. It is creating the "buffer" file which determines what to display as "virtual"**
